Atypon Front End Engineer assignment

Nunjucks decision
----------------

I used nunjucks to break down the test into partials instead of php, because as a quick to setup test i was aiming to use as few tools as possible.

Fonts:
This is the free version of fonts, which are not exactly the right ones for the project (i opted to use those anyway since its a quick test). I am aware that they are smaller and bolder than the right ones.


Add setup steps
--------------

Future steps
--------------
a) Better tree: example, separate node_modules and package-lock.json from the rest of folders and files. (done)
