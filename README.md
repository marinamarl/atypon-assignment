Atypon Front End Engineer assignment
=================

Nunjucks decision
----------------

I used nunjucks to break down the test into partials instead of php, because as a quick to setup test i was aiming to use as few tools as possible.

Fonts:
I have opted for not using any fonts as there were none specified, but using the svgs from  figma. Fonts can be very specific for each project and so didnt want to use just ones that 'looked' similar.

Add setup steps
--------------

Future steps
--------------
a) Better tree: example, separate node_modules and package-lock.json from the rest of folders and files. (done)

b) breakpoint at 780px

c) mobile responsive
